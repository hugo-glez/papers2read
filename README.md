# Papers2read is a collection of papers that I consider interesting enough to share

These lists include books, chapters, papers, etc.
They are organized by months, include tags to identify the topics. Also authors and links are included.

I did not read all those papers, but at least the abstract. Usually I skip trough the papers when they are freely available.
